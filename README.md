🚀 Project Overview
This project helps farmers choose the best crop to grow based on soil and weather conditions using Machine Learning. It analyzes soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to recommend the ideal crop for maximum yield and sustainability. 🌱🌞🌧️

🛠️ Built With :
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy 📊
Scikit-learn (Random Forest) 🌲
Flask (Web app) 🌐
Ipywidgets (Interactive inputs) 🎛️

🎯 Features
User-friendly input for soil and weather parameters 🎚️
Accurate crop prediction based on the trained model 🎯
Interactive widget testing in Google Colab 🧪
Simple Flask web app example for deployment 🌍

🧰 How To Use
In Google Colab
Run the notebook with interactive sliders to input values and get crop suggestions instantly. ⚙️

Web App
Run the Flask app and open the web page
Enter inputs and get crop recommendations on the page 🖥️

📂 Dataset
Uses real soil nutrient and climate data with crop labels. Data is preprocessed (scaling, encoding) to optimize model accuracy.

📈 Results
The Random Forest model shows strong prediction accuracy and can reliably guide crop selection for improved farming efficiency. 🎉

🔮 Future Plans
Add weather forecast integration ☁️
Expand to mobile app 📱
Provide soil health tips and multiple crop recommendations 🌿
